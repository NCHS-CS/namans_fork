This document is a starting template you will use for your Design Document. You will complete each section separately in phases and grades. You may take this document and import it to a new google document if you want to create your design document in google, otherwise you may keep this in the doc folder with your github project (recommended).

You should delete the instructions as you fill in each section.

## Title Block

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
| **Project Title** |  |
| Name 1 | `First student name`  |
| Name 2 | `Second student name` |

The document is split into three phases, which have their own due dates (see the [Schedule](schedule) for more info). **You should complete the three proposal phases BEFORE you begin coding.** 

You should be using the same document throughout this project. Any new sections mentioned in the phases should simply be appended onto your document.

As you approach the end of your project, there will be final updates to add to your design document to match the state of your project. You will not have to worry about this until the last week or two before the project is due.
