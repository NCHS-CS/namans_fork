{:toc}

# Design Document (55)

## <a name='Rubric'></a>Phase 1 (20 pts)

- 80% of your grade for Phase 1 will be determined by providing all sections completed on time.
- 20% will be provided once you have approval on your phase 1 to move to phase 2.

The approval may be graded after the due date and will not be late. However, you must get this signed off and complete well before phase 2 is due to be graded without deduction.

##  <a name='Rubric'></a>Phase 3 (20 pts)

| **Category**               | **Criteria**                                                                         | **Points** |

| **Detailed Design**    | - Class Design & Data Structures are well-structured with appropriate attributes, methods with key parameters and return types.<br>- Explains how classes communicate, share data, and interact within the system.<br>- Describes important algorithms with step-by-step logic or pseudocode.<br>- User Interface & External Libraries (if applicable): Outlines key UI components, interactions, and any third-party libraries used with justification.<br>- Satisfies requirements in the Detailed Design Template (design diagrams, user stories etc) | 15      |
| **User Stories**    | - Each tasks on the schedule has at least 1 user story referenced writted per the definition provided. | 5   |
| **Testing Strategy** | - Provided a description of the different test strategies you will use (e.g. Manual, UI testing, Automated/Junit testing). You convinced me that your program will behave as you expect by having sufficient details on the testing. For manual testing you provided some detailed steps on the tests you will run through. | 3 |
| **Algorithms** | - Clearly documents key algorithms (If your project has approval for no algorithms, your detailed design will be weighted with these points) | 2 |

# Project Completion (60)

The following rubrics break out the assessment by different areas. 

## <a name='Updates'></a>Updates (10 Pts)

Your updates will be graded out of 10 points. You must submit your updated Design Document to match your finished project

This update should include updates to your design diagrams and any changes on the algorithms that you actually ended up implementing.

### New Sections

Add the following sections to your design document.

1. `Updated Design` - Minimum required to update your actual completed class diagram - you may also update other diagrams, but it is not required.
2. `Final Features` - Create a table of your expected "core features" and a second column of your actual features implemented.
3. `Lessons Learned` - Move your original "Learning Targets and Goals" to a new table and add a second column that is a summary of `Actual lessons learned`. Summarize your lessons learned throughout the project here.

## <a name='Functionality50'></a>Functionality (40 Pts)

{: .warning }
If you copy code (even small amounts) from the internet, from AI or other sources, you **MUST** attribute the origin of that code or you will receive a overall penalty grade. (Add the attribution links to your README.md file)

Appropriate number of hours is evident (5 hrs/week). | Completed some MVP features. Shows a lack of effort and dedication (3-4 hrs/week). | A long way from appropriate effort and completion. |

## <a name='Presentation'></a>Presentation (10 Pts)

You will be peer reviewed for your presentation but overall grade for the presentation will be assessed as follows below.

If you are not present on your presentation day you may present on the first day back to class for full credit but your partner will still need to present separately on the presentation day.


| **Criteria**               | **Exemplary (100%)** | **Satisfactory (80%)** | **Not Yet (60%)** | **Unassessable (0%)** |

| **Formal Presentation** | Thorough presentation of project: functionality, learnings, and experience. Professional slides and/or presentation. | Demonstrates functionality and some insight into the development experience. No slides necessary. Reasonable quality of presentation. | Falls short of sharing functionality or experience. Presentation lacks quantity or quality. | Missing or woefully disorganized, lacking details. |
