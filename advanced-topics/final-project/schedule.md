##  <a name='Timeline'></a>Timeline 25-26

Your task list **must** have weekly milestones. You can update these each week but the initial version will remain in your Project Proposal.

 - **Design** - We will be doing design from week 6 --> 10 (5 weeks)
 - **Development** - This will happen from week 11 --> 18 (10 weeks)
 - **Delivery** - From week 19 --> 23 - Note that your presentation is due on the day you are scheduled to present; if you are absent you still must submit your presentation by this day (so it's good to have it earlier). You may swap presentations days with someone else if they agree (and they match you as senior presenters, or not)
